* 일시 : 2018년 7월 12일 (목요일) 오후 2시 - 5시

* 제목 : Tidal Deformability of a Neutron Star

* 연사 : 김영민 (UNIST)

* 초록 : Tidal deformability is an important property of neutron stars, which depends on the inner structure of neutron stars under the influence of an external tidal field. The effect of tidal deformability of a neutron star in binary system can be detected by gravitational wave observation, and it was realized by the observation of GW170817 in LIGO and Virgo collaboration. In my talk, I will describe how to derive tidal deformability of a neutron and discuss it. In addition, the recent estimations of the tidal deformability based on GW170817 including my recent calculations with Skyrme-type nuclear equations of states will be summarized.
