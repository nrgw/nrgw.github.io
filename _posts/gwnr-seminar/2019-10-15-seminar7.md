* 일시 : 2019년 10월 15일 화요일 오후 2시 - 5시

* 장소 : 서울대학교 56동 521호

* 제목 : 1+3 formalism

* 연사 : 박찬 (서울대학교)

* 초록 : General relativity is a covariant theory that does not favor a coordinate or basis. However, its actual measurements and interpretations require the introduction of some local coordinate or basis. In particular, when timelike congruence is given in the spacetime, 1+3 formalism provides systematic way of splitting time and space. We reconstruct the 1+3 formalism by introducing a connection adapted to the conguence. Its application to the relativistic fluid will be discussed.
